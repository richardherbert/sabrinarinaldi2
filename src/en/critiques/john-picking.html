<p>Sabrina Rinaldi is an Italian painter who is making a name for herself as a wildlife artist. This is a specialization dominated by British and Americans. There are few animal painters in Italy and even fewer who have reached the technical and expressive quality of Rinaldi. However, she has nothing to envy in the work of her American and British counterparts, in fact she has brought to this field of art the particularly classical painterliness and clarity of the long tradition of Italian painting, which for centuries has occupied a foremost position in the history of art.</p>

<p>She has inherited a strong sense of drawing which gives structure and compositional force to her work. Apart from using drawings as preparatory works for paintings, she has recently produced many drawings which are works of art in their own right with rich graphic qualities and rendering of form. Particularly forceful in their impact are her drawings using sanguine and sepia contè pastels.</p>

<p>Rinaldi is very thorough in her research into her subjects. She studies the animal’s natural poses and gestures managing to reveal the inner character of her subject. The result is a synthesis of study and love for the creature she is painting, leaving in the mind of the beholder an unforgettable image. This sense of the inevitability of everything in the picture is a sign of what it takes to be a good painter.</p>

<p>The expressive presence of an animal painted by Rinaldi respects its intrinsic character. No false human sentiments are attributed to them. Unlike the paintings of Landseer, there are no animals with human tears, no oversweet sentimentality. Each subject is depicted in its true colours, respecting its position in the animal kingdom, making no compromise with the unnatural “civilising” effect of humans.</p>

<p>Rinaldi always places her animals in their natural habitat. This has involved her in an attentive study of the landscapes of many parts of the world, and especially of Africa. Her elephants, arriving at their watering place at dawn, evoke the grandeur and spaciousness of this continent with its clear gradated skies and intense atmosphere. But she is as much at home with the snow-covered mountains of Asia, the stamping ground of the panda, or the hillsides and woods of Europe, the home of the fox.</p>

<p>Rinaldi has developed a strong sense of the balance of colour in the landscape and its relationship with the occupant of the foreground. In addition she has a strong tactile sense of both the qualities of the animal’s coat and the elements of the landscape. The painting of a leopard on the bough of a tree demonstrates how the use of the palette-knife can create a great sense of three-dimensional space. She has extended the use of this impasto technique to the rendering of the skin or shells of reptiles, reproducing effectively their rugged character.</p>

<p>Rinaldi lives and works in Lombardy, in the North of Italy. But she does not work in isolation. She is in contact with wildlife artists from other parts of the world and continues her assiduous research into the subjects of her paintings and of the achievements of other painters working in a similar field. She is on the way to becoming an international name in this branch of art.</p>

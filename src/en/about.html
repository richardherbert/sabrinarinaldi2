<p>She was born in Brescia and lives in Adro, a small village in the heart of Franciacorta.</p>

<p>Her passion for painting, along with her interest in nature and animals, led her to finally choose the wildilfe-animal art as her main field.</p>

<p>Animals have always been her main source of artistic inspiration, portraiying her pets in a more or less successfull way since she was able to hold a pencil in her hand.</p>

<p>As a self taught painter, she continued to draw and paint animals, experimenting with different techniques such as ink, watercolor, acrylic, soft pastels, painting on porcelain, etc., but she specializes in oil.</p>

<p>During the years, she partecipated in different local art associations, until she met master prof. John Picking in 2003 and happily started to attend his classes. During those years, the artist refined her stroke and oil technique, developing her own style.</p>

<p>Even though she focuses on anatomy and nature settings, her primary goal is to represent the animals in an artistic way, rather than scientifically.</p>

<p>She's not a scientific illustrator, but a painter who artistically expresses her admiration and knowledge to the subjects she paints. The experimental use of various techniques, incorporating different materials on canvas, clearly show her interest in expanding her pictorial language, enriching it with expressiveness.</p>

<p>The artist paints preferably African wildlife, but she's also very attentive to Italian and Europan species (mostly estinguished, reintroduced or species that are in danger).</p>

<p>She actively supports the major animal-environmental oriented charities such as WWF, Greenpeace, Doctors Without Borders, LAV and Lipu; through her art, she tries to raise public awareness to the great natural wealth we must absolutely preserve.</p>

<p>Part of the gain she gets from selling her paintings is donated to humanitarian and environmental associations: that's her way to show her personal gratitude to Mother Nature, for allowing her to create her works.</p>

<p>Her works were showed in many exhibitions and art competitions, in Italy and abroad, always receiving great success and good critics.</p>

<p>Her works are in private and public collections.</p>
